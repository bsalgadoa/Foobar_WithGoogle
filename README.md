# Foo.bar With Google - The "secret" invitation-only hiring process!

<br> Let me start this by saying that 3 months ago I had never programmed anything.<p> 
(Yes, besides an Introduction to Programming done in 2013 at Codecademy (9y ago) my first 'Hello World' was on April 21)

<br> Now two and a half months later, last Saturday (07/02/2022) I was googling some Python question I had and suddenly, the search bar unraveled and a this blackish banner appeared!

<p> I honestly thought it was some google commemorative day and moved on with what I was doing but, <b>fortunately</b>, something caught my attention and I decided to left that tab open to come back later just to realize that it was a Google Foobar Challenge!

<br> For those who are not familiar with the challenge, this is a "secret" invitation-only Google hiring process for programmers and developers all across the world, that you can do with Python or Java.
<br> Apparently that are only two ways to do it, one is trough Direct Invitation (like happened to me) and the other is with a Personal Invitation sent by someone that had previously participated. 
<br> Once invited, you get to solve coding challenges, and if you complete them, some say you'll get a shot at a direct interview with Google. 

<br> There are 5 levels in total to complete and so far I've solved Level 1 and challenge 1 of Level 2.
<br> Once you request a challenge, the clock starts ticking and you're in for a ride! 

<br> I don't know where this will lead me, but this is freakin awesome!!
