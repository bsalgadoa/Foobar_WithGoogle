# Foo.bar With Google - "The secret invitation-only hiring process!"
Let me start this by saying that **3 months ago I had never programmed** anything before. 
Yes, besides an Introduction to Programming class done in 2013 at Codecademy (9y ago), my first 'Hello World' was on April 21, 2022.

Now last Saturday (Jul 7, 2022) - just two and a half months later - I was googling some Python question I had and suddenly, the search bar unraveled and a this blackish banner appeared!

 I honestly thought it was some kind of *Google's homepage commemorative day* and moved on with what I was doing but, **fortunately (!)**, something caught my attention and I decided to left that tab open to come back later, only to realize that it was a **Google Foobar Challenge!**

 >For those who are not familiar with the challenge, this is Googleâ€™s invite only secret hiring process for programmers and developers all across the world, that you can do with Python or Java.[^1]
 >
 >Apparently that are only two ways to do it, one is trough Direct Invitation (like happened to me) and the other is with a Personal Invitation sent by someone who had previously participated. 
 >Once invited, you get to solve coding challenges and if you complete them, some say you'll get a shot at a direct interview with Google. 

I am pursuing a new career and I've been learning programming, doing AoC and CodeWars so, as soon as I realized what it was, clicking at `I want to play` was a nobrainer! 

 There are 5 levels in total[^note] to complete and so far I've solved Level 1 and challenge 1 of Level 2.
 Once you request a challenge, the clock starts ticking and you're in for a ride! 

I don't know where this will take me and I have no illusions here. I'm not a genius and probably wont be at their desired level but so what? This is freakin' awesome anyway!! 
 
I'm very excited with the challenge itself, but also very happy and proud of what I've accomplished. I can look back and humbly say that (so far) I've solved 2 challenges of Google and damn, that feels good :)

Lastly, a special thanks to my *Senpai*, **Kiwi**, who have been challenging me for the last couple of months! 
 Without your mentoring, I wouldn't had made such progress in such short time. Thanks man!
